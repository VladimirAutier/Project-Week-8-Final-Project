## Project Description

* Copper is a commodity that has a broad spectrum of use. It is part of many infrastructure structures and is now used in car batteries among other metals such as lithium or cobalt. Because of its large impact in our society, a drop or an increase in its price might signify that something is happening in the economy. Moreover, there is this historical belief that the Price of Copper is "an estimator" for how well the global economy is doing. The main objective of this project is to check if the Price of Copper can be an actual estimator of global economy just as the GDP or the Yield Curve. I directed my attention to this topic because the world of commodity is of great interest to me.

* N.B: The main country that drives the global economy is China. Thus, construction in China could also be an estimator of how well copper, the economy is doing.

## Hypotheses / Questions

* The main question I asked myself: Can Copper price be considered as an economic estimator of the health of the economy?

* I believe that commodities have and will still have a strong implication in the well-being of the global economy. Therefore, using Copper price to get an insight of how the economy is behaving is interesting. It can be used as an additional tool for controlling the behaviour of the economy.

* To answer my original question I decided to compare estimators (economic estimators) with a without the influence of Copper.I want to check if considering Copper as an estimator, I can predict with more accuracy the next economic recession.


## Dataset

* The datasets I have used are mainly issued from the US federal reserve but also other different website that allowed me to get the price of Copper for a large period of time.

 Most of the data was provided in Excel format or CSV format.

* Those are the links where I retrieved the data:

## Cleaning

* I have separated my work in 6 different notebooks. Notebooks 1-4 are dedicated to cleaning. I reduce the data sets to a viable format in order for me to perform machine learning. I did not get rid of outlierâ€™s values as I want all the possible information available. I did drop some missing values; however, they did not influence my results.

## Analysis

* I separated my analysis into two steps. I decided to work with 3 main economic estimators: GDP, Yield Curve (Spread) and the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI).

* I used those economic estimators because they are known to be good indicators of how the economy is doing. In other words, are we moving into a period of growth or recession? The goal of my analysis was to check if by adding or removing the price of Copper to the equation, the estimation of recession was going to improve or not.

* To perform my analysis before modelling, I worked on the price of Copper over a period of 50 years and looked for patterns and insights. However, I did not get any strong patterns or seasonality which would have helped me to perform a SARIMA model (Time Series). Thus, I used an alternative tool for Time Series which is called Prophet and that allows me to predict future prices for Copper. In order for Prophet to be able to compute information I had to resample the dataset by month. By adopting this strategy of month resampling I had to be consistent with this approach. Therefore, when I used Prophet on the other economic parameters, I encountered an issue with the GDP parameter which was defined every year (I could not perform a month resampling). In order to overcome this situation and still be consistent with my project I decided not to use the effect on GDP to predict recession.

* With the use of Prophet I was able to predict values for 2020 for each parameter (CCI,Copper,Yield). Using the predicted values but also existing values I used supervised Machine Learning to test my estimations but also check if Copper could improve the accuracy of my model.

## Model Training and Evaluation

* In order to perform Machine Learning in this project I used 2 or 3 economic parameters to observe if the economy was in recession or not (the target value). The target value is a Boolean value, meaning that it will take a 0 value is the economy is not in recession and a 1 otherwise.

* In order for me to test if Copper could be considered as a good estimator for detecting recession, I had to perform 2 models, one with the influence of the price of Copper and another one without. As my targeted value is a Boolean I decided to perform a random forest & logistic regression algorithms on the data

* The process I used for both models is the following:

-First I trained the model on a portion of the existing values(1970:2006) that I have to test on another portion of the existing data to check if the model is accurate(2006:2009).I looked at this specific portion because it is the time period where the last economic recession took place. 
- Then I followed the same process but now on all the existing values (train) to test the predicted values that I obtained using Time Series with Prophet.

* I obtained promising results:

- In the first step of my modelling I observed that by including the price of Copper as a parameter in the model, allows me to perform a more accurate estimation of the economic situation. Moreover, the random forest algorithm performs better than the logistic regression as the F1 score is better with random forest.

- Then I used this intuition to perform the same modelling on the predicted values. Again, the price of Copper was helping the model to get better results.


## Conclusion

* With this project I have been able to see that we can consider the price of Copper as a new tool to estimate the evolution of the global economy. Moreover, with this model I have been able to estimate as well how the economy will behave in 2020. According to my results we should not expect a recession. Of course, those results are highly hypothetical, and we should perform other tests to enhance my analysis.

## Future Work

* To go further in this project, I would like to retrieve more information on other economic estimators such as the level of debt of each country (especially China). China is the main driver of the global economy but also the main driver for the price of copper. China is the main consumer, producer and exporter at the same time of this commodity. In other words, the global growth for commodities but also the global situation depends on China's behaviour. Therefore, I would look at China's behaviour and the level of debt accumulated by every country.

## Workflow

* I have used many statistical tests to measure the accuracy of my models:
F1 score, AUC score, confusion matrix, accuracy score, cross validation.

* Each of those tests gave me the assumption that the random forest algorithm was working the best on the model that included the price of copper and other economic estimators.

## Organization

* I did use a Trello board to put down the questions that I had and to establish to process I needed to follow to be able to answer them.

* My folder is constructed in the following way:

- A folder with the jupyter notebooks that involve notebooks 1-4(Cleaning & Visualisation),that helped me understand the data and prepare the data for Machine Learning. The notebooks 5&6 are used for Machine Learning and model building.

- A folder with the original data I used.

- A folder with the transformed data sets.

- A folder with the Powerpoint presentation of the topic and some economic insights.
